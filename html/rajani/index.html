<h2>History Yakshagana Dance</h2>
<p class="history">The Yakshagana dance form came into existence during the 11th-16th Century in coastal Karnataka and Kasargod district of Kerala. Etymologically Yakshagana means the songs of the Demi-Gods. The performance includes songs, dance, and dialogues that narrate the poems of Yakshagana. The Vaishnava Bhakti movement, which spread its roots in the 11th Century, is the inspiration of this narrative dance. A sage named Narahari Thirtha started performing Dashavathara in the 13th Century in Udupi, which later developed into Yakshagana today. The plot of the Yakshagana dance revolves around the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.</p>

    <h4 id="mooda">Moodalapaya </h4>
    <p><span>Moodalapaya</span> is the old form of the Yakshagana dance, and this dance form is still prevalent in the village where the lead singer lives. Unlike the famous folk dances, Moodalapaya is not a commercial dance form. The primitive quality of the dance was achievable because of its limitation within the village of the lead singers. </p>
    <h4 id="padu"> Paduvalapaya</h4>
    <p>Paduvalapaya is the more popular of the two types of dance forms. The Yakshagana dance shown to tourists when they visit Karnataka is Paduvalapaya. This particular type of dance form further has two groups. </p>

    <p>Art cannot take place without artists. Artists are the most essential part of any show. The Yakshagana artists are professionals who immerse themselves into the role they play. In the Indian tradition, dance troupes from earlier days were of all male members only. The Yakshagana male artists play the female parts and portray the female characters very beautifully. Nowadays, these troupes have become more inclusive. Women are also part of these performances. Some Yakshagana dance groups are all women as well. </p>
    <h4>Facial Makeup of Yakshagana Dance</h4>

    <p>Theatre demands a lot of expressions. Artists need to skillfully express every movement through their faces and graceful dance moves. Makeup is, therefore, a very vital part of the dance. It puts a lot of emphasis on the elaborate facial makeup of the artists. They use natural dyes to paint their faces. The inspiration for the intricate makeup is visuals and sculptures. Particular attention is given to role-specific makeup.  </p>
    <h4>Headgear and Costumes of Yakshagana Dance</h4>

    <p>The folk dance of India is famous for its dynamic costumes and fancy headgears. The evocative headgears are beautifully made. The headgears are called Yakshagana Pagade and are custom-made for each actor and performance. The costumes are also very colourful and vary according to the role the artist plays. </p>
    <h4>Music of Yakshagana Dance</h4>

    <p>The use of live instruments for performance bring out the authenticity of the Yakshagana dance. The music is in perfect synchronization with the dance moves, and the artists’ dialogues are efficiently in sync with the music. Flute, drum, harmonium, cymbals, and Maddale, a drum variation, are the accompanying musical instruments. The speciality of Yakshagana dance is the unique combination of cymbals and Maddale. </p>
