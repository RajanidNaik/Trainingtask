<h3 style="color:blue ;">Chittani and Yakshagana</h3>
<p>Chittani Ramachandra Hegde is one of the few names that Badaguthittu brings to mind. The Badagu style of Yakshagana is the coming together of dialogue, dance and acting. When all the three aspects are in the right proportion, the character that is portrayed comes out as required. This style of Yakshagana provides a great scope for the growth of the character portrayed. In fact Yakshagana is one art that provides a huge canvas for the characters to come to life. Probably no other art form offers that scope. As a result, the growth of the artiste means the growth of the character and hence the growth of the art itself. </p>
<hr/>/thumtroupe that Chittani became part of, had nothing to worry about as all the shows ran to packed houses whenever Chittani performed. It would not amount to exaggeration if one were to say that Chittani was the only 'box office hero' in the history of Yakshagana. </p>
<hr/>
<p>According to his fans, some of the characters portrayed by Chittani have actually been created by him. Bhasmasura-Mohini's Bhasmasura, Gadhayudda's Kaurava, Sudhanvarjuna's Arjuna as well as Sudhanva, Keechaka, Jarasandha, Karthaveeryarjuna, Dushtabuddhi, Maghagada, kamsa, kaladara, Rudrakopa among others, are characters which he mastered. He has grown with the characters he portrayed and the characters too have grown with him. Chittani was more of an entertaining artist. </p>
